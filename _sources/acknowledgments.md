# Discussions and Study Group Committees

<p style="text-align:justify;">
The conception of this collaborative reproducibility challenge originated from discussions with experts, including Paul Tofts, JoÃ«lle Barral, and Ilana Leppert, who provided valuable insights. Additionally, Kathryn Keenan, Zydrunas Gimbutas, and Andrew Dienstfrey from NIST provided their code to generate the ROI template for the NIST phantom, which was also helpful. Dylan Roskams-Edris and Gabriel Pelletier from the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) offered valuable insights and guidance related to data ethics and data sharing in the context of this international multi-center conference challenge. The 2020 RRSG study group committee members who launched the challenge, Martin Uecker, Florian Knoll, Nikola Stikov, Maria Eugenia Caligiuri, and Daniel Gallichan, as well as the 2020 qMRSG committee members, Kathryn Keenan, Diego Hernando, Xavier Golay, Annie Yuxin Zhang, and Jeff Gunter, also played an essential role in making this challenge possible. Finally, we extend our thanks to all the volunteers and individuals who helped with the scanning at each imaging site.
