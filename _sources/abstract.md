# Abstract

#### Results of the ISMRM 2020 Joint Reproducible Research & Quantitative MR Study Groups Reproducibility Challenge on T1 mapping

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Purpose:</b> T1 mapping is a widely used quantitative MRI technique, but its reproducibility remains inconsistent among research groups. In 2019, the ISMRM Reproducible Research study group (RRSG) and Quantitative MR study group (qMRSG) jointly launched a T1 mapping reproducibility challenge. The goal was to explore if an independently-implemented imaging protocol at multiple centers could reliably measure T1 using inversion recovery in a standardized phantom.

<b>Methods:</b> To conduct the challenge, a gold standard protocol and fitting algorithm to measure T1 maps from the inversion recovery experiment was chosen (Barral et al. 2010). Participants who lacked access to the standard ISMRM/NIST phantom were encouraged to acquire healthy human brain data instead. Data submission, sharing, pipeline development, and analysis scripts were done on open-source platforms for reproducibility and  transparency.

<p style="text-align:justify;">
<b>Results:</b> Nineteen participants submitted data, resulting in a total of 41 datasets acquired in phantoms and 56 datasets in healthy human subjects. Most phantom datasets produced good T1 results relative to the temperature-correct reference values within the human range of T1 values. Inter-participant mean COV was 6.1% for phantom measurements, nearly two times higher than an intra-participant COV (2.9%). A similar trend was observed in the human data (inter-/intra- participant COV was 6.0/2.9 % genu and 16/6.9 % in the cortical GM).

<b>Conclusion:</b> This challenge generated a large database of inversion recovery T1 mapping open datasets across several sites and MRI vendors. In addition, a common fitting and analysis pipeline was developed, which could be used by the community to develop more robust T1 mapping techniques in the future.
